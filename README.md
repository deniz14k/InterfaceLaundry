App description summary:

- Digitize intake and handovers with QR-based item/order tracking.

- Designed hybrid routing: local TSP (NN + 2-opt) , then Google optimizeWaypointOrder with traffic, generating accurate ETAs + polylines.

- Dynamic route reconfiguration (add/remove/reorder stops) with duplicate-assignment guards and instant ETA refresh.

- Delivered customer portal: OTP login, per-item status timeline, live driver location, secure expiring links, and notifications.

- Built driver UI (start/complete stops, one-tap navigation) and staff tools (bulk status updates, route create/update, QR reprint).

- Result: significant reduction in status calls (target ~60–75%), faster handovers, fewer labeling errors.
